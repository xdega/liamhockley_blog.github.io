# And... we're back!

It's time to update my personal website/blog. While I'm at it, why don't I share what I've been up to over the past couple of years? What have I been learning, and what are my growth plans moving forward?

## What have I been learning over the past couple of years?

First and foremost, since my last blog post, my professional day-to-day work has shifted focus to Dart and Flutter. During this time, I have rapidly gained experience in native app development using these tools.

Specifically, I am currently building rich native app experiences, collaborating with tech artists, and utilizing the Rive runtime for Flutter. This opens up exciting possibilities and has been a fantastic experience.

Over the past year, the growth of AI tools has been significant. I have quickly adopted this technology where it makes sense in my day-to-day work. Additionally, I've made efforts to closely monitor this evolving tech landscape as the "AI Arms Race" continues. There are definitely some topics here for future blog posts.

Lastly, there's this project. I've been wanting to redesign my personal blog site for a while now. Fortunately, I recently discovered Static Shock, a static site generator for Dart, which has provided an excellent opportunity to apply my growing familiarity with Dart and replace my old Gatsby project (previous blog).

That's the summary for now. There's plenty more to discuss in future posts regarding these topics.

## What are my growth plans moving forward?

I'm planning to build a "tools" website focused on AI-related apps and tooling. Currently, I have a Python-based REST API using FastAPI. I intend to use this API as the backend for a frontend app that will allow various tasks under a few main categories:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) on text inputs, sentiment analysis, GPT
- Object recognition in images, OCR, etc.
- Project/user management for future projects/apps

I also want to rewrite my Python API in Julia—the "new shiny"—but only after I have a functional API in Python, so I can compare the two end results effectively.
