# About Me

Since a young age (late 1990s), I have been fascinated with using code to generate a formatted output. For the longest time, this meant web design. I would purchase discount magazines on the topic while being in awe of an exciting media landscape that involved technologies like Macromedia Flash. I remember being floored by the websites that 2Advanced Studios would publish. It was the start of a lifelong love.

It wasn't until much later in life (2010s) -- as the lines between software and the web became ever more blurry -- that I began to nurture my love of coding. Unhappy with my current job, I finally attended university to study computer science. Not only did this fulfill a childhood dream, but it also helped clarify my love of web development. I networked with a peer and began professional contract work in PHP and WordPress. I would later switch my major in college (to Communication) and dedicate my final couple of years to researching Computer-Mediated Communication. This would tie two interests together and allow me to broaden my studies. Tim Berners-Lee once said, "The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space where you can communicate through sharing information."

Once I graduated, I landed my first professional role as a web developer at a small School Management System SaaS product. This was an incredible experience where I wore many hats, explored many technologies, and grew in my craft. During my tenure, I began coding in PHP and HTML and ended up in Ruby on Rails and Vue.js.

Fast forward to today: I am approaching a decade in the education technology domain, building learning apps for children in sunny Los Angeles. I began with PHP and JavaScript, and today I use Flutter/Dart every day.

I look forward to the future. I strive to grow every day, learn something new, and continue to study my craft as a Full Stack Software Engineer who loves working on the frontend and greatly values lifelong learning.
